# Distributed-Optimization
Distributed optimization (DO) in a multi-agent setting refers to a class of algorithms in which a collection of agents—each with access to only a portion of the global objective or local constraints—collaboratively solve a joint optimization problem by exchanging information over a communication network. Here, we showcase DO using MATLAB.
